# Christmas Announcement Fix

This is a plugin for the Northwood Plugin API.

All it does is fixing the Christmas version of the NTF entrance announcement.

Since Northwood missed a space over a year ago, the vanilla game skips the part "has entered the workshop. All remaining elves are advised to seek shelter in the nearest gingerbread house until the unit has festivized the Facility"

## Harmony

Add [this dependency](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases) or the plugin won't do anything!
